01. Explain the MVC architecture in Laravel.

🟣 Model: Represents the data layer and business logic; interacts with the database using Eloquent ORM.
🟣 View: Represents the presentation layer; Laravel uses Blade templates to display data.
🟣 Controller: Acts as the intermediary; handles user requests, processes data via models, and returns the appropriate view.

-----------------------------------------

02. What is a Model in Laravel?

🟣 A Model is a PHP class that represents a database table.
🟣 Models interact with the database using Eloquent ORM.
🟣 Each model typically corresponds to a single database table.

-----------------------------------------

03. What is the purpose of fillable and guarded properties in the Model?

🟣 Only one of them is usually used at a time — using both together can cause confusion.
🟣 $fillable is recommended when you want full control and explicit allowed fields.
🟣 $guarded = [] means all fields are mass-assignable (not recommended for sensitive models).

-----------------------------------------

04. What is the Mass assignment?

🟣 Mass assignment happens when Laravel fills a model’s attributes using an array (e.g., $request->all()).
🟣 Without protection, it can allow attackers to set sensitive fields (like is_admin, role, balance).
🟣 Laravel blocks unsafe mass assignment unless the attributes are explicitly allowed using $fillable.



-----------------------------------------

05. What are controllers in Laravel?

🟣 Controllers are PHP classes that handle application logic.
🟣 They process incoming requests and return responses such as views, JSON, or redirects.

-----------------------------------------

06. What is a resource controller?

🟣 A resource controller handles CRUD operations for a specific resource.
🟣 Automatically provides methods like index, create, store, show, edit, update, destroy.
🟣 Simplifies RESTful routing and controller structure.
🟣 Example:
    ▫️ php artisan make:controller PostController --resource
    ▫️ Route::resource('posts', PostController::class);

-----------------------------------------

07. What is Blade templating engine?

🟣 Blade is Laravel’s simple yet powerful templating engine used to build dynamic views.
🟣 Allows writing PHP inside templates with a cleaner, more expressive syntax.
🟣 Blade files use the .blade.php extension.
🟣 Key Features:
    ▫️ Template inheritance (layouts and sections).
    ▫️ Displaying data using {{ $variable }}.
    ▫️ Control structures like @if, @foreach, @while.
    ▫️ Including sub-views using @include.

-----------------------------------------

08. What are views in Laravel?

🟣 Views contain the HTML and presentation logic of the application.
🟣 Located in the resources/views directory.
🟣 Use the .blade.php extension when using Blade templating.
🟣 Returned from controllers using the view() helper function.
🟣 Data can be passed to views as an associative array in the view() helper.
🟣 You can also use the with() method to pass individual variables.
🟣 compact(): Creates an associative array from existing variables and their values.

-----------------------------------------

09. What are Accessors in Laravel?

🟣 Each Eloquent model has attributes.
🟣 Accessors allow you to transform these attributes when you read them.
🟣 But accessors also let you create new virtual attributes that do not exist in the database.
🟣 They do not change what’s stored in the database — only how the value appears when accessed.
🟣 In modern Laravel (+10), accessors use the Attribute class instead of the old getSomethingAttribute method.
🟣 You can apply any transformation you want:
    ▫️ Formatting names, Formatting dates, Adding computed values, Changing number formats, Creating virtual attributes.

-----------------------------------------

10. What is the difference between accessors and mutators?

🟣 Accessors:
    ▫️ Transform attribute values when reading them from the database.
    ▫️ Used to format or modify data before it is returned.

🟣 Mutators:
    ▫️ Transform attribute values when writing/saving them to the database.
    ▫️ Used to clean, format, or secure data before storage.

-----------------------------------------

11. What are query scopes?

🟣 Query scopes allow you to define reusable query in your Eloquent models.
🟣 They make queries more readable and maintainable by encapsulating common conditions.
🟣 Two types: Local Scopes and Global Scopes.
    ▫️ Local scopes are optional and called manually.
    ▫️ Global scopes are automatically applied to all queries.
    ▫️ Global scopes can be defined once and applied to multiple models to avoid repeating query logic.

-----------------------------------------

12. What is soft deleting?

🟣 Soft deleting marks records as deleted without physically removing them from the database.
🟣 Adds a deleted_at timestamp to indicate deletion instead of removing the row.
🟣 Soft deleted records are automatically excluded from normal queries.
🟣 Records can be restored later if needed.

-----------------------------------------

13. How do you include soft deleted records in queries?

🟣 Use the withTrashed() method to include both active and soft deleted records in the query.
🟣 Use onlyTrashed() to retrieve only soft deleted records.
