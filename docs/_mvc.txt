01. Explain the MVC architecture in Laravel.

🟣 Model: Represents the data layer and business logic; interacts with the database using Eloquent ORM.
🟣 View: Represents the presentation layer; Laravel uses Blade templates to display data.
🟣 Controller: Acts as the intermediary; handles user requests, processes data via models, and returns the appropriate view.

-----------------------------------------

02. What is a Model in Laravel?

🟣 A Model is a PHP class that represents a database table.
🟣 Models interact with the database using Eloquent ORM.
🟣 Each model typically corresponds to a single database table.

-----------------------------------------

03. What is the purpose of fillable and guarded properties in the Model?

🟣 Only one of them is usually used at a time — using both together can cause confusion.
🟣 $fillable is recommended when you want full control and explicit allowed fields.
🟣 $guarded = [] means all fields are mass-assignable (not recommended for sensitive models).

-----------------------------------------

04. What is the Mass assignment?

🟣 Mass assignment happens when Laravel fills a model’s attributes using an array (e.g., $request->all()).
🟣 Without protection, it can allow attackers to set sensitive fields (like is_admin, role, balance).
🟣 Laravel blocks unsafe mass assignment unless the attributes are explicitly allowed using $fillable.



-----------------------------------------

05. What are controllers in Laravel?

🟣 Controllers are PHP classes that handle application logic.
🟣 They process incoming requests and return responses such as views, JSON, or redirects.

-----------------------------------------

06. What is a resource controller?

🟣 A resource controller handles CRUD operations for a specific resource.
🟣 Automatically provides methods like index, create, store, show, edit, update, destroy.
🟣 Simplifies RESTful routing and controller structure.
🟣 Example:
    ▫️ php artisan make:controller PostController --resource
    ▫️ Route::resource('posts', PostController::class);

-----------------------------------------

07. What is Blade templating engine?

🟣 Blade is Laravel’s simple yet powerful templating engine used to build dynamic views.
🟣 Allows writing PHP inside templates with a cleaner, more expressive syntax.
🟣 Blade files use the .blade.php extension.
🟣 Key Features:
    ▫️ Template inheritance (layouts and sections).
    ▫️ Displaying data using {{ $variable }}.
    ▫️ Control structures like @if, @foreach, @while.
    ▫️ Including sub-views using @include.
