01. What is the purpose of the .env file?

🟣 The .env file stores environment-specific configuration values.
🟣 Contains sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and app settings.
🟣 Different .env files can be used for different environments (local, staging, production).
🟣 Values are accessed using the env() helper function.
🟣 Should never be committed to version control.

-----------------------------------------

02. What is the config directory used for?

🟣 The config directory contains all configuration files for the application.
🟣 Files like database.php, app.php, and mail.php store organized configuration settings.
🟣 Configuration values can be accessed using the config() helper.
🟣 Example:
    ▫️ database.php – Database connection settings.
    ▫️ mail.php – Email service settings.
    ▫️ filesystems.php – Storage disk configuration (local, S3, etc.).

-----------------------------------------

03. What is the DDoS Attacks

🟣 A DDoS attack (Distributed Denial of Service) is when a website or online service gets flooded with too much fake traffic all at once, so it slows down or stops working for real users.
🟣 Imagine a store with hundreds of fake customers blocking the entrance. Real customers can’t get in.
🟣 Hackers use many computers or devices (sometimes thousands) to send these fake requests at the same time.
🟣 The goal is usually to make a website crash or disrupt its normal operation.
🟣 Solution:
    ▫️ Use a DDoS protection service (like Cloudflare or AWS Shield)
    ▫️ Increase server capacity
    ▫️ Rate limiting
    ▫️ CDNs that having many branches so no single store gets crowded

-----------------------------------------

04. What is CSRF protection?

🟣 CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection prevents unauthorized commands.
🟣 Laravel automatically generates a CSRF token for each user session.
🟣 Forms must include the @csrf directive or _token field in Blade templates.
🟣 Validates that the request comes from your application.

-----------------------------------------

05. How Laravel handles CSRF in SPAs (React, Inertia, Next.js) ?

🟣 Since SPAs don’t use Blade forms, Laravel relies on cookies + headers instead of the @csrf directive.
🟣 XSRF-TOKEN cookie
    ▫️ Laravel sends a cookie named XSRF-TOKEN to the browser (usually via /sanctum/csrf-cookie).
    ▫️ This cookie contains the CSRF token.
    ▫️ Purpose: the frontend reads this token to include it in requests.
🟣 X-XSRF-TOKEN header
    ▫️ For POST, PUT, DELETE requests, the frontend sends the CSRF token from the cookie in the X-XSRF-TOKEN header.
    ▫️ Purpose: Laravel verifies the request comes from your own app and not an attacker.
    ▫️ Note: This is commonly used with Laravel Sanctum for SPA authentication.

-----------------------------------------

06. What is the @csrf directive?

🟣 The @csrf directive generates a hidden CSRF token field in forms.
🟣 Required for all POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests.
🟣 Laravel automatically validates this token.

-----------------------------------------

06. What are Laravel policies?

🟣 Policies are classes that contain authorization logic for a specific Eloquent model.
🟣 A Policy decides what a user is allowed or not allowed to do with a model.

-----------------------------------------

07. What is the difference between gates and policies?

🟣 Gates: Simple closure-based authorization checks.
🟣 Policies: Class-based authorization organized around models.
🟣 Gates are good for simple actions not related to models.
🟣 Policies are better for model-specific authorization.
🟣 Use the authorize() method in controllers.
🟣 Use the @can directive in Blade templates.
🟣 Use the can() method on user instances.

-----------------------------------------

08. What is Laravel Sanctum?

🟣 Sanctum provides a lightweight authentication system for SPAs and mobile apps.
🟣 Simpler alternative to Passport for most applications.
🟣 Example: $token = $user->createToken('token-name')->plainTextToken;

-----------------------------------------

09. What is Laravel Passport?

🟣 Passport is a full OAuth2 server implementation.
🟣 Provides complete OAuth2 authorization with tokens, scopes, and grants.
🟣 Both (Sanctum & Passport) are used for API authentication, but they are designed for different purposes.
🟣 Sanctum
    ▫️ Designed for simple APIs, SPAs (React/Vue/Next.js), and mobile apps
    ▫️ Much easier to set up
    ▫️ Uses lightweight tokens
🟣 Sanctum
    ▫️ Full OAuth2 implementation
    ▫️ like Google, Facebook, or GitHub have OAuth servers

-----------------------------------------

10. What are API resources?

🟣 API resources transform models and collections into JSON responses.
🟣 Provide a transformation layer between models and JSON.

-----------------------------------------

11. What is the difference between Resource and ResourceCollection?

🟣 Resource: Transforms a single model into JSON.
🟣 ResourceCollection: Transforms a collection of models into JSON.
🟣 ResourceCollection allows customizing the collection wrapper and meta data.

-----------------------------------------

. How do you secure a Laravel application?


🟣 Keep Laravel and dependencies updated
🟣 Use HTTPS
🟣 Implement CSRF protection
🟣 Validate and sanitize input
🟣 Implement proper authentication and authorization
🟣 Protect against SQL injection, XSS
🟣 Use environment variables for sensitive data
🟣 Enable rate limiting
🟣 Implement proper error handling
