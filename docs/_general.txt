01. What is Laravel?

🟣 Laravel is a free and open-source PHP framework.
🟣 Created by Taylor Otwell.
🟣 Follows the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture.
✨ Designed to simplify web development with clean, elegant syntax.
🛠️ Includes built-in features such as routing, authentication, sessions, and caching.

-----------------------------------------

02. What are the main features of Laravel?

🟣 Eloquent ORM for database operations.
🟣 Blade templating engine for clean and reusable views.
🟣 Artisan command-line interface for task automation.
🟣 Database migration and seeding for easy schema management.
🟣 Authentication and authorization built-in.
🟣 Routing system for defining web and API routes.
🟣 Middleware for request filtering and security.
🟣 Queue management for background jobs.
🟣 Task scheduling to automate periodic tasks.
🟣 Built-in testing support for unit and feature tests.

-----------------------------------------

03. What is Composer and why is it used in Laravel?

🟣 Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP.
🟣 Laravel uses Composer to manage its dependencies and packages.
🟣 Allows developers to easily install, update, and autoload libraries required for the application.

-----------------------------------------

04. What is Artisan?

🟣 Artisan is Laravel’s built-in command-line interface used to automate common development tasks.
🟣 Allows creating controllers, models, and migrations quickly via commands.
🟣 Supports running tests from the command line.
🟣 Example: php artisan make:controller UserController

-----------------------------------------

05. What are Laravel collections?

🟣 Collections are powerful wrapper objects around arrays that provide expressive, chainable methods for manipulating data.
🟣 They give you dozens of helpful methods (like map, filter, pluck, sum, first, count, etc.) to transform and work with data easily.
🟣 Example:
    ▫️ $users = User::all();
    ▫️ $names = $users->pluck('name');
    ▫️ $active = $users->where('active', true);

-----------------------------------------

06. What are service container?

🟣 The service container is Laravel’s system for giving your classes the objects they need automatically.
🟣 It is also called the IoC (Inversion of Control) container.
🟣 When you type-hint something in a constructor, Laravel checks the container and creates the needed class for you.
🟣 If your class depends on an interface, you must tell Laravel which real class to use.
🟣 Example binding: app()->bind(PaymentInterface::class, StripePayment::class);
    ▫️ app() → gives access to the service container
    ▫️ bind() → tells Laravel: “When someone needs PaymentInterface, give them StripePayment.”
    ▫️ Any time you type-hint PaymentInterface, Laravel automatically gives you a StripePayment object.

-----------------------------------------

07. What are service providers?

🟣 Service providers are Laravel’s setup files — they tell Laravel what to load when the app starts.
🟣 They are responsible for registering services, bindings, and any class you want the container to manage.
🟣 All service providers extend Laravel’s main ServiceProvider class.
🟣 You can find them in the app/Providers folder.
🟣 They have two important methods:
    ▫️ register() → Used to bind classes or interfaces into the service container. (Only registration, no logic that depends on other services.)
    ▫️ boot() → Runs after everything is registered. Good for: routes, events, observers, and anything that needs other services to exist.

-----------------------------------------

08. What is the IoC (Inversion of Control)

🟣 IoC is just another name for Laravel’s service container.
🟣 It means your code doesn’t create objects manually — the container creates them for you.
🟣 The container decides which class to build (based on your bindings).
🟣 This enables dependency injection, which makes your code cleaner, easier to change, and easier to test.

-----------------------------------------

09. What are differences between Service Provider and Service Container?

🟣 Service Container
    ▫️ The service container is the tool Laravel uses to manage and give you the dependencies your classes need.
    ▫️ Think of it like a smart box inside Laravel where: You store bindings (interface → implementation) - It handles dependency injection automatically
    ➡️ The service container is the machine that resolves dependencies.

🟣 Service Provider (What it does)
    ▫️ A service provider is the place where you tell Laravel WHAT to put into the container.
    ▫️ It is the class responsible for: Registering bindings - Registering events (protected $listen = []), routes, middleware, etc. - Bootstrapping parts of the application
    ➡️ A service provider is the place where you configure the container.

-----------------------------------------

10. What is the register() method in a service provider?

🟣 The register() method is used to bind classes, interfaces, or services into the service container.
🟣 It is used for registration only, not for running logic.
🟣 No access to request data should happen here.
🟣 Ideal for: Binding interfaces, singletons, helper services, repositories.

-----------------------------------------

11. What is the boot() method in a service provider?

🟣 The boot() method runs after all service providers have been registered.
🟣 Used to execute logic that depends on already-registered bindings.
🟣 Ideal for: Registering events, routes, observers, middleware aliases, custom validation rules.

-----------------------------------------

12. What is dependency injection?

🟣 Dependency injection is a design pattern where a class receives (is “injected with”) the objects it depends on instead of creating them internally.
🟣 Laravel automatically resolves and injects dependencies using type-hinting and the service container.
🟣 Helps make code more modular, testable, and easier to maintain.

-----------------------------------------

13. What are facades in Laravel?

🟣 Facades provide a static interface to classes in the service container.
🟣 Make Laravel services accessible with simple, expressive syntax.
🟣 Examples: Cache, DB, Mail, Storage, etc.

-----------------------------------------

14. What is the difference between a facade and a helper function?

🟣 Facades: Uses a class - Goes through Laravel’s service container - Better for testing and mocking
🟣 Helper functions: A simple global function - Calls things directly - Better for quick shortcuts

-----------------------------------------

15. What is Laravel Telescope?

🟣 Telescope is a debugging and monitoring tool for Laravel applications.
🟣 Provides insights into requests, exceptions, database queries, jobs, etc.
🟣 Invaluable during development for debugging.

-----------------------------------------

16. What is Laravel Tinker?

🟣 Allows interacting with your application from the command line.
🟣 Great for testing code, querying the database, and debugging.
