01. What is a migration in Laravel?

🟣 Migrations act as version control for your database schema.
🟣 They allow teams to define, modify, and share the database structure.
🟣 You can create, update, or drop tables and columns using migration files.
🟣 Help keep database changes consistent across different environments.
🟣 Example: php artisan make:migration create_users_table

-----------------------------------------

02. What is Eloquent ORM?

🟣 Eloquent is Laravel’s Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system.
🟣 Provides an elegant way for interacting with the database.
🟣 Each database table has a corresponding Model that represents and interacts with that table.
🟣 Makes querying and manipulating data clean, readable, and expressive.

-----------------------------------------

03. What is a database seeder?

🟣 A database seeder is used to insert initial, demo, or default data into your database.
🟣 Seeders help quickly set up testing or development environments without manual data entry.
🟣 Seeders are commonly combined with model factories to generate large amounts of fake data.

-----------------------------------------

04. What are factories in Laravel?

🟣 Factories generate fake or dummy data for Eloquent models — useful especially for testing and seeding.
🟣 They use the Faker library to automatically generate realistic values (names, emails, text, dates, etc.).
🟣 They speed up development by automatically generating data rather than manually inserting records.

-----------------------------------------

05. What are Eloquent relationships?

🟣 Define how database tables are related to each other. (Simplify tables relations)
🟣 Laravel supports multiple relationship types.

-----------------------------------------

06. Explain One-to-One relationship

🟣 One record in a table is associated with one record in another table.
🟣 Uses hasOne() and belongsTo() methods in models.
🟣 Example real-life: A User has one Profile.

-----------------------------------------

07. Explain One-to-One relationship

🟣 One record in a table is associated with one record in another table.
🟣 Uses hasOne() and belongsTo() methods in models.
🟣 Example real-life: A User has one Profile.

-----------------------------------------

08. Explain One-to-Many relationship

🟣 One record in a table is associated with multiple records in another table.
🟣 Uses hasMany() and belongsTo() methods in models.
🟣 Example real-life: A User has many Posts.

-----------------------------------------

09. Explain Many-to-Many relationship

🟣 Multiple records in one table are associated with multiple records in another table.
🟣 Requires a pivot (junction) table to store the relationships.
🟣 Uses belongsToMany() method on both models.
🟣 Example real-life: Users can have many Roles, and Roles can have many Users.

-----------------------------------------

10. Explain Has-Many-Through relationship

🟣 Allows accessing records in a distant table through an intermediate table.
🟣 Useful for relationships where a model is related to another via a third model.
🟣 Uses hasManyThrough() method.
🟣 Example real-life: A Country has many Posts through Users (Country → Users → Posts).

-----------------------------------------

11. Explain Has-Many-Through relationship

🟣 Allows accessing records in a distant table through an intermediate table.
🟣 Useful for relationships where a model is related to another via a third model.
🟣 Uses hasManyThrough() method.
🟣 Example real-life: A Country has many Posts through Users (Country → Users → Posts).

-----------------------------------------

12. Explain Polymorphic relationship

🟣 Useful when multiple models share a common relationship (like comments or images).
🟣 Uses morphOne, morphMany, or morphTo methods.
🟣 Example real-life: A Post and a Video can both have many Comments.

-----------------------------------------

13. What is Eager Loading?

🟣 Useful when multiple models share a common relationship (like comments or images).
🟣 Uses morphOne, morphMany, or morphTo methods.
🟣 Example real-life: A Post and a Video can both have many Comments.

-----------------------------------------

14. What is Eager Loading?

🟣 Loads relationships with the main query to avoid extra queries.
🟣 Prevents the N+1 query problem.
🟣 Uses the with() method in Eloquent.
🟣 It improves performance when accessing related models.

-----------------------------------------

15. What is the N+1 Query Problem?

🟣 Happens when you load a collection of models, and then for each item you access a related model.
🟣 That causes 1 query to fetch the main collection + N additional queries (one per item).
🟣 This can slow down performance, especially with large datasets.
🟣 Example: $users = User::all(); // This returns 100 users -> then loop for $user->profile->phone; So: 1 query for getting all users, 100 queries for getting each user's profile => 🔥 Total = 101 queries

-----------------------------------------

16. What Is Lazy Loading?

🟣 Lazy loading means Laravel loads relationships only at the moment you access them, not before.
🟣 It is the default behavior in Eloquent.
🟣 Although convenient, it can accidentally create N+1 problems if used inside loops or repeated accesses.
🟣 Useful when you don’t always need the relationship, but risky when loading many related models.

-----------------------------------------

17. What Is Lazy Loading?

🟣 Lazy loading means Laravel loads relationships only at the moment you access them, not before.
🟣 It is the default behavior in Eloquent.
🟣 Although convenient, it can accidentally create N+1 problems if used inside loops or repeated accesses.
🟣 Useful when you don’t always need the relationship, but risky when loading many related models.

-----------------------------------------

18. What Is Lazy Loading?

🟣 Accessors allow you to transform model attribute values when they are retrieved from the database.
🟣 They do not change what’s stored in the database — only how the value appears when accessed.
🟣 In modern Laravel (10–12), accessors use the Attribute class instead of the old getSomethingAttribute method.

-----------------------------------------

19. What is the difference between get() and first() in Eloquent?

🟣 get(): Returns a collection containing all matching records.
🟣 first(): Returns only the first matching record as a single model instance (or null if none is found).

-----------------------------------------

20. What is the difference between create() and save()?

🟣 create():
    ▫️ Mass-assignment method that creates and persists a new model in a single step.
    ▫️ Requires the model’s $fillable (or $guarded) property to be properly configured.
🟣 save():
    ▫️ Used on an existing (or newly instantiated) model instance to persist changes to the database.
    ▫️ Allows setting fields individually before saving.
🟣 Example:
    ▫️ Using create() — User::create(['name' => 'John', 'email' => 'john@example.com']);
    ▫️ Using save() — $user = new User; $user->name = 'John'; $user->save();

-----------------------------------------

21. What is the difference between get() and all()?

🟣 all(): Static method that retrieves all records directly from the table.
🟣 get(): Can be chained with query builder methods to filter results before retrieving.

-----------------------------------------

22. What is the find() method in Eloquent?

🟣 find(): Retrieves a model by its primary key.
🟣 Returns a single model instance if found, or null if no matching record exists.
🟣 Can also accept an array of IDs to retrieve multiple records at once (returns a collection).

-----------------------------------------

23. What is the difference between find() and findOrFail()?

🟣 find(): Returns null if the record does not exist.
🟣 findOrFail(): Throws a ModelNotFoundException when the record is missing.
🟣 findOrFail() is commonly used when you want Laravel to automatically show a 404 error page.

-----------------------------------------

24. What is the difference between delete() and forceDelete()?

🟣 delete(): Performs a soft delete if the SoftDeletes trait is used.
🟣 forceDelete(): Permanently removes the record from the database.
🟣 forceDelete() bypasses soft delete and actually deletes the row.

-----------------------------------------

25. What is the whereHas() method?

🟣 whereHas() filters results based on the existence of a relationship.
🟣 Returns only models that have related records matching the condition.

-----------------------------------------

26. What is the difference between with() and whereHas()?

🟣 with(): Eager loads relationships but doesn't filter the main query.
🟣 whereHas(): Filters the main query based on relationship conditions.
🟣 Can be used together for optimal results.

-----------------------------------------

27. What are database transactions?

🟣 Transactions ensure that a series of database operations succeed or fail together.
🟣 If any operation fails, all changes are rolled back.
🟣 Maintains data integrity and consistency.

-----------------------------------------

28. What is the difference between beginTransaction() and transaction()?

🟣 transaction(): Automatically handles commit and rollback.
🟣 beginTransaction(): Requires manual commit() or rollback() calls.
🟣 transaction() is safer and recommended for most use cases.

-----------------------------------------

29. What are database indexes?

🟣 Database indexing is a way to make database searches faster.
🟣 An index is like a book’s table of contents — it helps the database find data quickly without scanning the whole table.
🟣 Why indexing is used:
    ▫️ Speeds up SELECT queries
    ▫️ Makes searching, filtering, and sorting much faster
🟣 Without index → database checks every row (slow)
🟣 With index → database jumps directly to the matching rows (fast)

-----------------------------------------
