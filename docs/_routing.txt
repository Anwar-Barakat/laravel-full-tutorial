01. What is routing in Laravel?

🟣 Routing defines how the application responds to incoming HTTP requests.
🟣 Routes are defined inside the routes/web.php (web routes) and routes/api.php (API routes) files.
🟣 Each route maps a URL to a controller method, closure, or action.
🟣 Each route hits a controller method, action, or closure.

-----------------------------------------

02. What are named routes in Laravel?

🟣 Named routes allow you to assign a name to a route for easier reference.
🟣 Makes it easier to generate URLs and redirects without hardcoding paths.
🟣 Can be referenced throughout the application using the route() helper.
🟣 Example:
    ▫️ Route::get('/profile', [ProfileController::class, 'show'])->name('profile');
    ▫️ Usage: route('profile')

-----------------------------------------

03. What is the difference between Route::get() and Route::post()?

🟣 Route::get(): Handles HTTP GET requests (used for retrieving or displaying data).
🟣 Route::post(): Handles HTTP POST requests (used for submitting or creating data).

-----------------------------------------

04. What is a request in Laravel?

🟣 The Request object contains information about the current HTTP request.
🟣 An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (like a browser or mobile app) to a server to ask for data or perform an action.
🟣 It consists of several parts: method, URL, headers, query parameters, body, and cookies.
🟣 In Laravel, the Request object wraps the HTTP request and provides easy access to its data.


-----------------------------------------

05. How do you retrieve input data from a request?

🟣 Use the input() method to retrieve a specific input value.
🟣 Use the all() method to retrieve all input data from the request.
🟣 Use the has($key) – Checks if a specific input key is present.
🟣 Use the query($key, $default) – Retrieves query parameters (from URL).
🟣 Use the only($keys) – Retrieves only specified input fields.
🟣 Use the except($keys) – Retrieves all input except specified fields.
🟣 Use the method() – Returns HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).

-----------------------------------------

06. What is the HTTP?

🟣 HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of communication on the web.
🟣 Uses a request-response model:
    ▫️ Client sends a request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
    ▫️ Server responds with data (HTML, JSON, files, etc.)
🟣 Requests and responses include headers, body, cookies, and status codes.
    ▫️ Browser sends GET request to /users → Laravel controller returns JSON or view.

-----------------------------------------

07. What is the difference between input() and query()?

🟣 input(): Retrieves values from all input sources (query string, form data, JSON payload).
🟣 query(): Retrieves values only from the query string (URL parameters).
🟣 Both work similarly, but query() is more specific when you only want URL parameters.
🟣 Example:
    ▫️ $name = $request->input('name');
    ▫️ $sort = $request->query('sort', 'asc');

-----------------------------------------

08. What is the difference between input() and query()?

🟣 input(): Retrieves values from all input sources (query string, form data, JSON payload).
🟣 query(): Retrieves values only from the query string (URL parameters).
🟣 Both work similarly, but query() is more specific when you only want URL parameters.
🟣 Example:
    ▫️ $name = $request->input('name');
    ▫️ $sort = $request->query('sort', 'asc');

-----------------------------------------

08. What is redirecting in Laravel?

🟣 Redirecting sends the user to a different URL or route.
🟣 Done using the redirect() helper or Redirect facade.
🟣 Can redirect to:
    ▫️ Specific URLs – redirect('/home')
    ▫️ Named routes – redirect()->route('profile')
    ▫️ Previous page – redirect()->back()
🟣 Can also attach flash messages with with() for notifications.
🟣 Example:
    ▫️ return redirect()->back()->with('status', 'Profile updated!');

-----------------------------------------

09. What is flashing data to the session?

🟣 Flash data is stored in the session only for the next request.
🟣 Useful for one-time messages like success, error, or info notifications.
🟣 Automatically removed after being accessed once.
🟣 Example:
    ▫️ return redirect('/home')->with('status', 'Post created successfully!');

-----------------------------------------

10. What are route parameters?

🟣 Route parameters capture dynamic values from the URL.
🟣 Defined using curly braces {} in the route definition.
🟣 Automatically passed to the controller method as arguments.


-----------------------------------------

11. What is the difference between required and optional route parameters?

🟣 Required parameters: Must be present in the URL.
🟣 Optional parameters: Marked with a ? and can be omitted.
🟣 Optional parameters must have a default value in the controller method.
🟣 Example:
    ▫️ Route::get('/posts/{id}', [PostController::class, 'show']); // Required parameter
    ▫️ Route::get('/users/{name?}', [UserController::class, 'show']); // Optional parameter and in public function show($name = 'Guest') {}

-----------------------------------------

12. What are route groups?

🟣 Route groups allow sharing attributes across multiple routes.
🟣 Can share middleware, prefixes, namespaces, and more.
🟣 Reduces code duplication and improves organization.

-----------------------------------------

13. What is route prefixing?

🟣 Route prefixing adds a common URI prefix to all routes in a group.
🟣 Useful for API versioning or organizing related routes.

-----------------------------------------

14. What is route model binding?

🟣 Route model binding automatically injects model instances into routes.
🟣 Laravel resolves the model based on the route parameter.
🟣 Eliminates the need to manually find models by ID.

-----------------------------------------

15. What is implicit vs explicit route model binding?

🟣 Implicit: Laravel automatically resolves models based on type-hinted parameter names.
🟣 Explicit: You manually define how to resolve the model in RouteServiceProvider.
🟣 Implicit Example: Route::get('/users/{user}', fn (User $user) => $user );
🟣 Explicit Example: Route::get('/users/{user}', fn (User $user) => $user );

-----------------------------------------

16. What is rate limiting in Laravel?

🟣 Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a user can make in a time period.
🟣 Prevents abuse and protects against DDoS attacks (too much fake traffic hitting a server until it can’t handle real users.).
🟣 Applied using middleware on routes.
